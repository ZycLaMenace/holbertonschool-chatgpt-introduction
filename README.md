Introduction to ChatGPT debugging
This project is about two key parts of software development: debugging and automation. 

- **Debugging:** You'll learn how to use AI, like ChatGPT, to find and fix errors in code. This will help you get better at solving problems and understanding common coding mistakes in different programming languages.

- **Automation:** You'll also learn how to use ChatGPT to automate boring and repetitive coding tasks, like writing basic code or creating simple tests. This will save you time so you can focus on more interesting and creative parts of coding.
